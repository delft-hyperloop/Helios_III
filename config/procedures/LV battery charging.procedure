People:
Needs to have some experience with powertrain and Emus BMS
Needs to have some experience with electrical

Items:
LV protection gloves 
safety glasses
Multimeter
Power supply
Laptop with Emus BMS Control panel
LV Battery

Procedures:
This procedure is performed when LV battery is off the pod

Person B opens the battery box
Person A checks if the LV switch is turned off (to the left) takes out the low-voltage battery and puts it on the charging station
Person A connects the battery to the laptop
Person A reads out BMS and sees if there are any errors, protections or anomalities, if everything is fine continue
The power supply is plugged into a power socket and turned on, the voltage of the power supply is set to 25 V and the output current to 0 A
The low voltage charging connector is plugged in to the LV power socket
When ready, person A switches the manual switch to "ON"
Person A checks if everything is okay in the BMS software while person B sees if the power supply gives.approximately  0 A
If everything is okay, person B slowly increases the current to 8 A, while person A checks if the current measurement of the BMS is accurate
Wait until the battery is charged, while always AT LEAST one person remains present, and the BMS values are checked at least every 5 minutes
If the battery is charged to 24 V, the power supply current is turned down until it reaches 0 A
The power switch on the battery is turned off
The current connector is disconnected
The power supply is turned off
Person A takes the battery using insulating gloves, and puts it in the battery box, which person B opens for him
Person A calculates the slope of the voltage of the laser sensor using :slope = (V2-V1)/(2mm)
Person A changes the slope in the PMP to the calculated value
Person B measures the distance from magnet A to the track and announces it to Person A.
Person A changes the offset parameter in the PMP software until the measured value of the laser sensor is the same as the actual distance measured by person B.
Person A writes down this offset value.
Repeat steps ID.10 to ID.18 for all laser sensors.
Person A recompiles the config file using the new values for slope and offset for each sensor.
Low voltage is turned off according to DH08.PROC.PWRT.LVBATTERY_DEACTIVATION
