People:
Needs some experience with EMUS G1 Control Panel
Needs some experience with powertrain

Items:
500 V power supply
Laptop with EMUS G1 Control Panel
EMUS G1 BMS Control Unit + appropriate cables
Insulating gloves
Safety Glasses

Procedures:
[If off pod] Batteries are dismounted and transported to designated charging place following HVBATTERY_DISMOUNTING and HVBATTERY_TRANSPORT procedures
2 battery packs/enclosures are taken out of the battery box, for both packs it is checked if the MID is off
The top pieces of both enclosures are taken off
The CCGM's of both packs are connected, and one of the CCGMs is connected to the control unit
The Control Unit is connected to the laptop
The laptop is read out by person A, and it is validated if all values are appropriate and there are no protections, warnings or errors
Person B, wearing insulating gloves, connects the packs in series by connecting the NEGATIVE (black) and POSITIVE (orange) poles together
The power supply is plugged into a power socket and turned on
The output switch on the power supply is turned off
Person B connects the POSITIVE (orange) pole of the first battery pack to the POSITIVE (red) pole of the power supply, putting the wire through the current sensor of the EMUS BMS
Person B connects NEGATIVE (black) pole of the second battery to the NEGATIVE (black) pole of the powersupply
The maximum output voltage off the power supply is set to 430 V
The maximum output current of the power supply is set to 0.5 A
Both MID's are closed by person B wearing insualting gloves, saying 'High Voltage on'
Person B counts down and switches the output switch of the power supply on
Person A checks if the voltages rise as expected, and no errors occur
If the batteries behave as expected, the maximum output current of the power supply is gradually set to 5 A, while Person A keep checking the Control Panel for anomalies
The batteries are charged to 420 V. During this period both people will remain close to the batteries, but there should be at least 1 person present AT ALL TIMES
When the batteries are fully charged, the power output of the power supply is set to 'off'
If necessary, the batteries will be further balanced by the BMS
When balanced, both MID's are opened by person B wearing insulating gloves
The two packs are placed back into the battery box.
