People:
Needs experience with PMP software and its parameters.
Procedure assistant

Items:
2 mm shimplate
Safety googles
Insulating gloves
Safety shoes
Ruler/Caliper

Procedures:
Person A is sitting in the ground station
Person B is magnet safe and wears all PPE.
Person B is standing next to the pod.
Low voltage is started on the pod according to DH08.PROC.PWRT.LVBATTERY_ACTIVATION
Person A starts up the PMP software
Person A connects to the Arcas
Person A sets the busstate machine to preoperational and waits for all Cygni to be recognized by the PMP.
Person A uploads the config file.
Person A sets the busstate machine to safe operational.
Person A checks the voltage value for laser sensor A and writes it down.
Person B places a 2 mm shimplate against the track in front of laser sensor A
Person A checks the voltage value for laser sensor A and writes it down.
Person B can now take out the shimplate.
Person A calculates the slope of the voltage of the laser sensor using :slope = (V2-V1)/(2mm)
Person A changes the slope in the PMP to the calculated value
Person B measures the distance from magnet A to the track and announces it to Person A.
Person A changes the offset parameter in the PMP software until the measured value of the laser sensor is the same as the actual distance measured by person B.
Person A writes down this offset value.
Repeat steps ID.10 to ID.18 for all laser sensors.
Person A recompiles the config file using the new values for slope and offset for each sensor.
Low voltage is turned off according to DH08.PROC.PWRT.LVBATTERY_DEACTIVATION
