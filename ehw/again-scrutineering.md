- [ ] display all individcell voltages
- [ ] cut off floating points
- [ ] remove insulation from vitals if it is not measured
- [ ] remove 1-7 shortcuts
- [ ] prevent shitty line splits (`High\nVoltage`, `HV Relays\nOff`) 
- [ ] debug why tf it doesnt connect without flashing (voltage issue?) (it connects if i plug it into my laptop without needing to flash it)
- [ ] visual confirmation that button was pressed *and* that the main pcb received the command
- [ ] number for what override was set
- [ ] wtf is propulsion temperature = 10000
