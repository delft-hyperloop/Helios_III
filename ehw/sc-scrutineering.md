# Sense and Control Scrutineering
- for "procedures", write a short document explaining the steps that need to be taken in order to demonstrate this item to the Scrutineering team.
- rest of the todo's are due 9th of July.
- sensecon testing to happen after lunch on 9th July

## Necessary Procedures
1. [ ] [G] Power On procedure 
2. [ ] [G] Power Off procedure
3. [ ] [A] All State Transition procedure
4. [ ] [A+Gz] All safe actuations brakes, contactors, relays, valves)
5. [ ] [A] Out Of Range values cause emergency brake 
6. [ ] [A+*] System is moved by hand - is navigation handled properly and state machine correct for this manual run
7. [ ] [G?] Demonstrate end of track 
8. [ ] [G+Gz] (brief) Gonzalo->Goose explains principles of braking pcb

## Still Missing 
- [x] [F] a chart/diagram/reference for LEDs interpretation
- [ ] [K+F] Safe range for monitored variables is clearly indicated.
- [ ] [A] Demonstratorâ€™s health must be visible to an external viewer using colored visual indicators.
- [ ] [F] confirmation on validity of state-of-charge
- [ ] [F+A] Sensor failures properly handled
- [ ] [A] Proper explanation of how system indicates end of run
- [ ] [A] System left stationary for longer time in initial state - is navigation and possible drift handled properly?
- [ ] [F] Sensor hub send Datapoint of who caused an emergency brake 
- [ ] [A+K] Demonstrator health should be easily visible by external viewer
- 

## Other todo's 
- [ ] [K] +2 rows on cell LV voltages (similar to HV)
- [ ] [K] last procedure on list is not visible 
- [ ] [K] procedure content not entirely visible
- [ ] [K] newlines in procedure content

## Powertrain Scrutineering
- we need to test insulation for 100V, 250V and possibly 400V 
- fix measuring resistance between HV+ and LV ground 
- [ ] [F] "fix IMD"
